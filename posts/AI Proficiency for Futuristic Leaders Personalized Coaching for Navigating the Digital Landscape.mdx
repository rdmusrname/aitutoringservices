## The Importance of AI Proficiency for Leaders

* **Gain insights from data:**  AI can be used  to collect and analyze large amounts of  data providing leaders with valuable insights into their customers, competitors, and the market. This information can be used to develop new products and services, improve customer service, and make better strategic decisions.
